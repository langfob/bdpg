## Different types of reproducibility

All this stuff about setting random seed needs some more documentation and 
examples of use beyond what I've put in the function documentation.  

However, there's one thing that needs to be discussed related to what kind of 
reproducibility you're seeking.  Most of what I've been working on has been 
aimed at reproducing the same exact path through the code for debugging purposes.  However, another type of reproducibility is related to the reproducibility of the statistical properties of a set of experiments, i.e., if you use a different set of data from the same distribution, do you get results that have similar statistical properties to your original results?  This is more of a scientific sense of reproducibility compared to a programming sense of reproducibility.
