    #  The following couple of lines were used to test the new version of the
    #  rrunner.R code in tzar.
    #  The changes there were done to improve the output when your R code
    #  crashes while running tzar, e.g., to generate a traceback.
    #  The first line here was just to make the rrunner generate a warning.
    #  The second was to make it generate a fatal error and crash the program.
    #  I'm going to leave these in here in case I need to go back and test
    #  rrunner crash behavior under tzar again later.
