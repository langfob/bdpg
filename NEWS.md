# bdpg 3.1.0  (2021-03-03)

## Release 3.1.0

* Close to what was used in experiments for bdpg papers

This represents the bdpg code that is fairly close to what was used in experiments for bdpg papers. Some small bugs have come up in the course of writing the papers and this release captures the code before fixing those bugs since these fixes were not there in the experiments. Even this state of the code is not exactly what was used in the papers though, since other bug fixes and small features were adding as they were discovered during experimentation.
