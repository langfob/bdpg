}
\arguments{
\item{rsprob}{a reserve selection problem object, e.g., a Xu_bd_problem}

\description{
The bdpg package computes bipartite measures over the PU/spp network in
two ways, one using the igraph package and the other using the bipartite
package.  This function computes values using the bipartite package.
}
\section{Cautions about metric name confusion}{


The bipartite package looks at bipartite networks through the lens of
plant-pollinator or parasitoid-prey networks.  Specifically, in the
bipartite documentation, it breaks a web into 2 groups as follows:

"Web is a matrix representing the interactions observed between higher trophic
level species (columns) and lower trophic level species (rows). Usually this
will be number of pollinators on each species of plants or number of
parasitoids on each species of prey."

\itemize{
   \item{HL=PUs=columns}
   \item{LL=Spp=rows}
   \item{species=PUsAndSpp}
}

This means that measures coming out of the bipartite package are named as if
the graph was a plant-pollinator network.  This, in turn, means that some
metric names need to be re-interpreted for the reserve selection problem.

In bdpg, species are rows and planning units are columns, i.e., in bdpg,
planning units correspond to the higher trophic level species and reserve
selection "species" correspond to bipartite lower trophic level species. For
example, when bipartite says something like "number of species", that means
the total number of both plants and pollinators together (i.e., both
groups/levels in the network, since plants and pollinators are both species.
In the reserve selection problem, that means the total number of both planning
units and species together, rather than just the species involved in the
reserve selection problem.

\section{Choice of metrics vs. speed of computation}{


Information about which indices are slow is taken from the R documentation for
the networklevel function in the bipartite package in its section called
"Reducting computation time".  Here is that section to help understand
the choices made in the compute_network_measures_using_bipartite_package()
function.
}

\section{Reducing computation time}{


Some indices require rather long computation times on large webs. If you want
to increase the speed by omitting some indices, here a rough guide: Ask only
for the indices you are interested in! Otherwise, here is the sequence of most
time-consuming indices:

\enumerate{
   \item{The slowest function is related to extinction slopes and robustness. Excluding
both makes the function faster.}

   \item{weighted cluster coefficient is also very time consuming (an exhaustive search
for 4-loops in the one-mode projection of the network). Omitting it can
dramatically boost speed.}

   \item{Degree distributions are somewhat time consuming.}

   \item{Fisher's alpha is computed iteratively and hence time consuming.}

   \item{Nestedness and weighted nestedness are not the fastest of routines.}

   \item{Number (and diversity) of compartments calls a recursive and hence relatively
slow algorithm.}

   \item{H2 and specialisation asymmetry require an iterative, heuristic search
algorithm. Finally, excluding discrepancy can also moderately decrease
computation time.}
}
}

\section{Local Variable Structures and examples}{

Here is the output of str() for each variable visible in the function.
Note that the particular counts and values given are just examples to show
what the data might look like.
