\title{See if there are any duplicate links}
\usage{
see_if_there_are_any_duplicate_links(occ_matrix, num_spp, bdpg_error_codes)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ_matrix}{occupancy matrix, integer matrix with one row for each
species and one column for each planning unit.  Each matrix entry
specifies whether that species occupies that planning unit; 1 indicates
the species does occupy the planning unit and 0 indicates it does not.
Same as bpm.}

\item{num_spp}{integer number of species in the problem}

\item{bdpg_error_codes}{list of error names and corresponding error codes}
}
\value{
Returns an edge list, a two column integer matrix of
    node IDs with one row for each edge and columns for the 2 ends of
    the edge; quits if any duplicate edges are found.
}
\description{
I'm not certain, but I think that the original Xu algorithm doesn't allow
duplicate links.  I don't think that they would invalidate the solution,
but I suspect that they could make the problem easier by giving more
reasons to choose a pair of planning units.  Consequently, I'm looking for
duplicate links.
}
\details{
Note that you can only uniquely decode an edge list from an occurrence
 matrix if the species only occurs on 2 patches, i.e., the underlying
 assumption in the Xu problem generator.
 However, the only reason I'm building this routine now is to run it
 on the Xu benchmark problems to see if those allow any duplicate
 edges, i.e., more than one species occurring on the same pair of
 patches.
